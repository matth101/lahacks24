If you had to come up with a vibe of music for the area around 1432 4th Street, Santa Monica while taking into account the current time of day (6:26 AM) and weather of the area (overcast clouds), what would that vibe be? Please consolidate the recommendations for the type of vibe into a list. At the end, can you combine those into a prompt for a music generation model and begin the prompt with a @ symbol so I know where it starts?
